I've been playing piano for a long time (since I was 6). I used to play almost exclusively classical music and did a bunch of competitions because I liked feeling like I was good at piano. See [here](https://youtube.com/catherinezng) for my Youtube channel.

Later at MIT, I continued playing in trios for a couple years but then I had an existential crisis related to feeling like the way I played music wasn't C R E A T I V E!!!

So my friends and I started jamming in a band together. And that was... extremely fun haha (some of my absolute favorite MIT memories).

# Brief background:

- Studied with Ruo Huang Balko, [Roberta Rust](http://www.robertarust.com/) from Lynn Conservatory, and chamber music with [David Deveau](https://mta.mit.edu/person/david-deveau) at MIT.
- Graduated from Dreyfoos SOA and BAK SOA (performing arts schools) as a Piano Major.
- My fancy schmancy [braggity brag competition bio](https://southeasternpianofestival.com/study/participants/2015/#zeng).

# Original Music:

I am interested in writing original music. My MIT friends and I were part of a band called Long Winded. Our Youtube channel is located [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqN3KhL_UCuRmt779zJiS9Q). Poorly updated page of explorative improvisation / ideation [here](tunes).

- [Late Night in the City](https://youtu.be/icV59SnivY4) (improvised piano song)
- [A Little Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LvT2J-Da3E) (Long Winded)
- [Leonard the Newt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBv5vCy3-oo) (Long Winded)
- [Tell Me Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wah_I0fOKSc) - Wrote, Produced, Sang


I bought Pro Tools after a cool dude from Berklee convinced me to buy it at Guitar Center. So I spent a summer + a few months learning it and became a noob producer.
