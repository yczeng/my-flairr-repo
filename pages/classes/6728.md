# 6.728 Introductory Applied Quantum & Statistical Mechanics

This is my favorite class at MIT. Professor Hagelstein is enormously dedicated. Going to Professor Hagelstein's office hours are some of my favorite MIT memories. Also my friend Jamison taught me so much as well. 

I really like physics, although I don't think I am very good at it. I hope to revisit this when I'm older and make a meaningful contribution to science one day.

# Final Study Guide
[This](/assets/classes/6728/final_study.pdf) contains important formulas and select problems that cover as much of the material as I could fit on the 16 pages allowed for a cheat sheet.
