Someone at MIT was trying to start a company related to a mechanically (ML?!?!) controlled dildo. The pitch was that 50% of women haven't orgasmed or something. She was trying to pay some MIT kids to build a mechanical prototype.

Zack thought it was hilarious so he dragged me into it, and we made this mechanical dildo together. Zack designed everything and I mostly just helped him make it according to his design because he was much more excited than I was.

We casted the dildo out of silicon, and used syringes to add pressure to soft-actuate the dildo.

Here's the [full system architecture](/assets/projects/dildo/full-system-architecture.pdf):

Here are some [ipad design notes](/assets/projects/dildo/ipad-design-notes-jan-3rd.pdf) related to how the syringes actuate the dildo:
