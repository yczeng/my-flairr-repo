Check out [Github](https://github.com/yczeng) where stuff like [hackernews-newsfeed](https://github.com/yczeng/hackernews-newsfeed) and [my-pet-rock](https://github.com/yczeng/my-pet-rock) live, and random crappy things like [python implementations of papers](https://github.com/yczeng/venkataraman-approach).

I've worked on other random projects in addition to the ones listed below... but I didn't do a great job documenting everything so things are lost. Or the media is disorganized and I'm too lazy to put it together.
