High-level things I want to do in my lifetime. I'm trying to make a habit out of making some progress at this bucket list everyday. Will probably tackle / prioritize in the order listed below because certain things are better to do for certain stages of life.

1) Start a successful company that helps people I care about.

2) Contribute to science in a non-incremental way

3) Make really, really good original music
