High-level things I want to do in my lifetime. I'm trying to make a habit out of making some progress at this bucket list everyday. Will probably tackle / prioritize in the order listed below because certain things are better to do for certain stages of life. I will add details to this as I figure things out.

# 1.Start a successful company that pushes forward something that I believe is important

# 2.Contribute to science in a non-incremental way

# 3.Make really, really good original music
