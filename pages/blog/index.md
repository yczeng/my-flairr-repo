A bloggity blog for your viewing pleasure! I don't have much time to write, however, I really like this quote:

```Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't." - Mark Twain```

So I think that is my preferred writing style. Basically... document funny things that I have experienced in my life (that are okay to share of course... hehe), and retell them in the humorous way in which I experienced them.
