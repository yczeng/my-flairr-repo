# High School

During early high school, I realized that I needed to do something nontraditional in my life because whenever things were too predictable... my brain would turn off (because I was bored maybe?). This made it very difficult to stay focused in structured environments. So I knew that I would be really bad at life if I chose a career path that was too predictable.

Later in high school, I realized that I wanted to be in charge of my own destiny. And that this was very important to me. It's strange because I simultaneously like chaos and yet I like control... (this doesn't make any sense?!?!) but anyways, I determined that starting a company was the best way to do that since I can work on something that matters to me, and decide how I work on it, and also work as hard as I want and have my work contribute directly to positive results.

Even later in high school, I worked on some projects involving WordPress and I realized that I need to learn how to code. Because if I can't code, then I'm always at the mercy of whatever is already out there for me to use. So I decided to go to MIT to learn how to code after I was rejected from Stanford. I am very grateful because I love MIT. CPW was one of, if not the best, weekend of my life. And I feel like I found my people at MIT.

# College

During college... especially early college, I was not very good at going to class and I hacked my way into getting Bs in classes by gaming the exams (it turns out you can guess what will show up on exams with approximately a B-level accuracy without actually have learned anything... so I learned almost nothing from almost all of my classes...) Outside of classes, however, I spent a lot of time trying to learn how to build things. At the time, this involved doing hackathons and working on lots of side projects in parallel (most of which would go no where haha).

However, one project did go somewhere. It was a boba machine that my friends and I built. We stuck this inside Jingwei's room where it was runnign 24/7. MIT folk would show up to buy boba at all times of the day (though there was a peak at 1AM?!?!). My friend Anna from my floor who was a little bit older, but wiser, and smarter than me applied to and got into Y Combinator that Fall. This really surprised me because I thought Y Combinator for adults, and I was a child. But we had this boba machine... so Robert and I applied to Y Combinator and got in (unfortunately Jingwei couldn't go because she is an international student :( ) That was life-changing!!! Y Combinator was such a big deal and I was beyond excited to participate in it. However, I also felt like an imposter... because I didn't feel like we deserved to get in and I had no idea what we were even doing trying to turn the boba machine into a company?

It turns out these feelings were right because... 3 months into Y Combinator... Robert and I wanted to quit. Also, we were living in a basement (since we were trying to save money on rent), and we were very depressed. Then Robert and I went to ring ceremony and we crashed with our friend from our floor in East Campus named Miranda. That trip made me very sad. Because I was so happy to be back at MIT, and so excited to all our friends, that I felt FOMO from "dropping out" of school to be at YC. I realized that college is so special because it lets you explore and experiment with no stakes! And exploration is important for learning so that when you do execute, you have full information.
