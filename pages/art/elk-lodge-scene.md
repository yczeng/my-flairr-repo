I painted this using acrylic on a 24" by 36" canvas.

The original picture was taken by [Zack](http://zackpi.com) when we went to Elk Lodge. It had lots of pretty colors and a cool reflection in the mirror of me, so I decided to paint it.

Here is the original picture:

Here is the painting with a filter applied. The colors make it look so much darker.
